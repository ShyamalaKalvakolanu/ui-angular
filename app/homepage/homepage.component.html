    A stock market, equity market or share market is the aggregation of buyers and 
   sellers (a loose network of economic transactions, not a physical facility or discrete entity) of
    stocks (also called shares), which represent ownership claims on businesses; these may include 
    securities listed on a public stock exchange, as well as stock that is only traded privately, 
    such as shares of private companies which are sold to investors through equity crowdfunding 
    platforms. Investment in the stock market is most often done via stockbrokerages and electronic 
    trading platforms. Investment is usually made with an investment strategy in mind.
    Stocks can be categorized by the country where the company is domiciled. For example, Nestl√© and 
    Novartis are domiciled in Switzerland and traded on the SIX Swiss Exchange, so they may be
     considered as part of the Swiss stock market, although the stocks may also be traded on 
     exchanges in other countries, for example, as American depository receipts (ADRs) on U.S. 
     stock markets.</i>
